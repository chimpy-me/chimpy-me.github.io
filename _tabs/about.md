## Welcome to the ~~Jungle~~ Chimpy Blog!

![A Chimpy Jungle Scene](/a_chimpy_jungle_scene.webp)

Chimpy was created out of a passion to **simplify the complex world of library data** and a desire to better understand elements and properties of a library collection. The broader Project CHIMP, aims to reduce friction between librarians and their data.

At the heart of Project Chimp is a simple yet goal: to make working with library data not just easier, but also enjoyable and fun. We believe that every librarian should have the power to understand and leverage their data without requiring a PhD in informatics.
